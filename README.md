# Description
<img src="/Assets/images/Capture.PNG" alt="Screenshot of how the webpage looks">
The task of this challenge was to create a task board that incorporated both jQuery and Day.js. The webpage consisted of three-coloumns with unique titles "To Do", "In Progress" and "Done", when adding new tasks the user will be prompted with a form that consist of "Title", "Description" and a drop box where you can select that "Date", which is made possible through the Day.js library. Furthermore, after creating a series of tasks' the user can also drag the containers between the three columns depending on the state of each task, also, the colours of the tasks will change depending on the due dates when left under "To Do" and "In Progress".
<ul>
<li>White - Due date is more than 1 day away</li>
<li>Yellow - Due date is less than 1 day away</li>
<li>Red - Task is overdue </li>
</ul>

# Installations

# Challenges
Some of the challenges I personally faced during this challenge was:
<ul>
<li>Typos - One of the simplest issues that I found myself repeating is the inconsistency of my spelling.</li>
<li>Understanding the .filter() method and using that over the splicing method, although still correct would be considered by many as inefficient.</li>
</ul>

# Improvements
<ul>
<li>Adding an edit button to the already set tasks would make the application a lot more versatile. This would allow the user to change the due dates if their due dates have been extended or that want to add extra notes into the description.</li>
<li>Adding a light and dark mode.</li>
</ul>
